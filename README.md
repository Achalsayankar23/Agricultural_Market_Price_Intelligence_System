\# 🌾 Agricultural Market Price Intelligence System

the right market and the right time to sell. Prices vary by location, demand, and time,

and farmers usually depend on middlemen or guesswork.



This project aims to provide farmers with \*\*market intelligence\*\* so they can decide

\*\*where and when to sell their crops to maximize profit\*\*.
